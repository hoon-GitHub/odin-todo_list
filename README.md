## The Odin Project: Todo List
Project assignment page: [Project: Todo List](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list)\
Project started on: **5/6/2024**\
Project finished on: **TBD**

### Project Planning
- Each todo item will be an object with properities (title, description, dueDate, priority, completion, tags, ...).
- There will be multiple todo lists (projects): probably use tabbed-browsing? Maybe make them to be simply filtered lists using tags?
- User should be able to add new item to the list and edit/delete an existing item.
- I should use webpack, and try to learn to utilize some other npm libraries.
- As instructed, I should use localStorage to store all data - I will be learning how to interact with JSON data!
- Just like the previous TicTacToe project, I will try to work separately on the UI portion from the fully-functioning console version of the application. So work on backend first, then the frontend.
- My goal is a simple and intuitive app, with a modern and minimalist design (look at community solutions for ideas/inspiration).

### Mid-Project Thoughts/Progress
- Took some time to brainstorm how to structure building blocks (todo items, projects, ...).
- Decided to use CLASS for popularity, rather than regular constructor or factory function.
- Debated if I should use tags for separating projects vs. make a project class to contain todos. Decided to go with a separate class.
- Decided to keep classes simple (at least to start out with) - constructor, add, remove, print..
- Later decided to remove the whole Project class, and instead add a property to Todo, to act similarly as tags (a major overhaul).
- Maybe I should try adding some animations?
